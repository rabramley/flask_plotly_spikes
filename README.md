# Flask Plotly Spikes

Actually these spikes are not only Plotly because I have also found the
[python-gantt](http://xael.org/pages/python-gantt-en.html) library.

## To Run
### Dash
The dash apps are run by executing:

```
python dashapp.py
```

and then going to http://localhost:8050

### Flask
The Flask apps can be run by executing:

```
python -m flask run
````

and then going to http://localhost:5000
